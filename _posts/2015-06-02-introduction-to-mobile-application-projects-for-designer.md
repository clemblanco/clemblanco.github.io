ðŸŽ‰ Whoop whoop! One of my pull requests on Laravel just got accepted.

[[5.2] Sending to a Specified Address (Global "to") #8894](https://github.com/laravel/framework/pull/8894)

I know, it's not much but it could be quite useful for other developers and it was a good experience
to actually develop, test and document the functionality.

Shout out to [GrahamCampbell](https://github.com/GrahamCampbell) who does a great work reviewing
pull requests with [taylorotwell](https://github.com/taylorotwell).

I've been working with other frameworks like Zend 11, Symfony 2, Drupal 7, Magento 1 and others but
I have to say Laravel is such a nice piece of software hand-crafted with love, by people who
genuinely care, while keeping it simple yet powerful. Its documentation is probably one of the best
thing about Laravel hence why I really wanted to document this PR too. Its truly open-source community
and the eco-system around it is also a big plus but this is another story.
