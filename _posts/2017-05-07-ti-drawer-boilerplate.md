Because it's quite common having applications using a Drawer Navigation and not that straight forward to have it up and running smoothly for both iOS and Android, I wanted to have something easily re-usable across multiple projects.

Originally we started this based on [HazemKhaled's](https://github.com/HazemKhaled) sample application [SideMenu-with-NavigationWindow-for-Titanium](https://github.com/HazemKhaled/SideMenu-with-NavigationWindow-for-Titanium).

After playing with it we decided to come up with a simple boilerplate so we could have a working base for both iOS and Android to start developing applications using a drawer menu base navigation.

It's pretty easy to spin it and check it out, have a look on [Github](https://github.com/Cyber-Duck/ti-drawer-boilerplate)!
