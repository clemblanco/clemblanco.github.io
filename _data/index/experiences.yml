  subtitle: Technical Lead | March 2017 - Now
  description: >
    Along the years, my role at Cyber-Duck evolved.
    I became involved in contributing to manage Cyber-Duck technical department and am now responsible for overseeing Cyber-Duck technical department team expertise by working on standards, streamlined processes and toolchains, as a team.
    I am still developing applications in object oriented PHP frameworks like Laravel using TDD and SOLID principles, just to name a few.
    Working closely from the project manager, our DevOps team and the developers, I keep getting involved in the technical production and supervision.
    This gives me the opportunity to be working at every technical level of a project.
    I'm also now responsible for developing and deploying mobile applications for clients using technologies like Appcelerator Titanium, Node.js and Web APIs.

    This role was first about taking over retainer projects, getting involved with project management while taking part to production and R&D projects too.
    I was developing applications in object oriented PHP frameworks like CodeIgniter, Laravel and Silverstripe.
    I was also working with other technologies like Appcelerator Titanium and Node.js, especially for R&D projects like <a href="https://uxcompanion.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">UX Companion</a> which is the first app to offer a full glossary of user experience (UX) terminology.

  subtitle: Web & Mobile Developer | January 2011 - March 2014

    Following a one year training contract, while finishing my M.Sc in Lyon FR with a thesis around modern web development and RWD (Responsive Web Design), I was given this opportunity to keep working as a full time web developer in the same startup I graduated.
    My role was originally around becoming a full stack web developer using technologies like Git, OOP, PHP5, JavaScript, Symfony 2, Sass, Drupal 7. This also gave me the opportunity to be more familiar with project management using Agile in a small team of four while also getting involved with account management.
    Among the years, my confidence evolved and this is also where I first experimented with truely native mobile development using a new technology (back then) called Appcelerator Titanium based on my web skills.
    This position also gave me the opportunity to get familiar into the open-source/community facet of our jobs.
    Attending conferences, writing articles for <a href="http://www.lafermeduweb.net" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">lafermeduweb.net</a>, helping organising conferences like the <a href="https://www.blendwebmix.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Blend Web Mix</a> or <a href="https://www.lacuisineduweb.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">La Cuisine Du Web</a> just to name a few.
