    Following a one year training contract, while finishing my M.Sc in Lyon FR with a thesis around modern web development and RWD (Responsive Web Design), I was given this opportunity to keep working as a full time web developer in the same startup I graduated.
    My role was originally around becoming a full stack web developer using technologies like Git, OOP, PHP5, JavaScript, Symfony 2, Sass, Drupal 7. This also gave me the opportunity to be more familiar with project management using Agile in a small team of four while also getting involved with account management.
    Among the years, my confidence evolved and this is also where I first experimented with truely native mobile development using a new technology (back then) called Appcelerator Titanium based on my web skills.
    This position also gave me the opportunity to get familiar into the open-source/community facet of our jobs.
    Attending conferences, writing articles for <a href="http://www.lafermeduweb.net" target="_blank">lafermeduweb.net</a>, helping organising conferences like the <a href="https://www.blendwebmix.com" target="_blank">Blend Web Mix</a> or <a href="https://www.lacuisineduweb.com" target="_blank">La Cuisine Du Web</a> just to name a few.
